/**
 * Provides an interface for creating and operating on {@link io.atomix.resource.Resource}s remotely.
 * <p>
 * This {@link ResourceClient} implementation facilitates working with {@link io.atomix.resource.Resource}s remotely as
 * a client of the Atomix cluster. To create a client, construct a client builder via {@link #builder()}.
 * The builder requires a list of {@link Address}es to which to connect.
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   List<Address> servers = Arrays.asList(
 *     new Address("123.456.789.0", 5000),
 *     new Address("123.456.789.1", 5000)
 *   );
 *   Atomix atomix = AtomixClient.builder(servers)
 *     .withProtocol(new NettyTransport())
 *     .build();
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * The {@link Address} list does not have to include all servers in the cluster, but must include at least one live
 * server in order for the client to connect. Once the client connects to the cluster and opens a session, the client
 * will receive an updated list of servers to which to connect.
 * <p>
 * Clients communicate with the cluster via a {@link Transport}. By default, the {@code NettyTransport} is used if
 * no transport is explicitly configured. Thus, if no transport is configured then the Netty transport is expected
 * to be available on the classpath.
 * <h2>Client lifecycle</h2>
 * When a client is {@link #connect() started}, the client will attempt to contact random servers in the provided
 * {@link Address} list to open a new session. Opening a client session requires only that the client be able to
 * communicate with at least one server which can communicate with the leader. Once a session has been opened,
 * the client will periodically send keep-alive requests to the cluster to maintain its session. In the event
 * that the client crashes or otherwise becomes disconnected from the cluster, the client's session will expire
 * after a configured session timeout and the client will have to open a new session to reconnect.
 * <p>
 * Clients may connect to and communicate with any server in the cluster. Typically, once a client connects to a
 * server, the client will attempt to remain connected to that server until some exceptional case occurs. Exceptional
 * cases may include a failure of the server, a network partition, or the server falling too far out of sync with
 * the rest of the cluster. When a failure in the cluster occurs and the client becomes disconnected from the cluster,
 * it will transparently reconnect to random servers until it finds a reachable server.
 * <p>
 * During certain cluster events such as leadership changes, the client may not be able to communicate with the
 * cluster for some arbitrary (but typically short) period of time. During that time, Atomix guarantees that the
 * client's session will not expire even if its timeout elapses. Once a new leader is elected, the client's session
 * timeout is reset.
