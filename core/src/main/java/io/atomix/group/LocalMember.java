 * A {@link DistributedGroup} member representing a member of the group controlled by the

 * Local group members can only be acquired by {@link DistributedGroup#join() joining} a membership
 * group. Local members provide the interface necessary to set member properties, receive messages,
 * and react to the election of the member as the group leader.
 * <p>
 * To receive messages sent to the joined member of the group, register a message consumer. Messages
 * sent to the member are associated with a {@link String} topic, and separate handlers can be registered
 * for each topic supported by the local member:
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   LocalGroupMember member = group.join().get();
 *   member.onMessage("foo", message -> System.out.println("received: " + message));
 *   }

   * this method is completed. Once this instance has left the group, the returned future will be completed.
   * <p>
   * This method returns a {@link CompletableFuture} which can be used to block until the operation completes
   * or to be notified in a separate thread once the operation completes. To block until the operation completes,

   * Alternatively, to execute the operation asynchronous and be notified once the lock is acquired in a different
   * thread, use one of the many completable future callbacks:
   * <pre>
   *   {@code
   *   member.leave().thenRun(() -> System.out.println("Left the group!")));
   *   }
   * </pre>
