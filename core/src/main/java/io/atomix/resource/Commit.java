  /**
   * Constants for specifying command compaction modes.
   * <p>
   * Compaction modes dictate how each command is removed from a Copycat server's internal logs. As commands
   * are submitted to the cluster, written to disk, and replicated, the replicated log can grow unbounded.
   * Command compaction modes allow servers to determine when it's safe to remove a command from the log.
   * Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the state machine and the command applied to it to indicate when
   * the command may be removed from the log. Typically, commands should not be removed from the log until
   * they either no longer contribute to the state machine's state or some other mechanism ensures that the
   * command's state will not be loss, such as is the case with snapshotting.
   * <p>
   * Commands to a Copycat state machine typically come in one of two flavors; commands are either compacted from
   * the log via snapshotting or log cleaning. Log cleaning is the process of removing commands from the log when
   * they no longer contribute to the state machine's state. Commands compacted via log cleaning are represented
   * by the {@link #QUORUM}, {@link #SEQUENTIAL}, and {@link #TOMBSTONE} compaction modes. These types
   * of commands are removed from the log in a manor consistent with the configured compaction mode.
   * <p>
   * Alternatively, the simpler mode of compaction is snapshotting. Snapshotted commands are indicated by the
   * {@link #SNAPSHOT} compaction mode. When a server takes a snapshot of a state machine, all commands applied
   * to the state machine up to the logical time at which the snapshot was taken may be removed from the log.
   * <p>
   * It's important to note that command compaction modes only take effect once a command applied to a state
   * machine has been released for compaction. State machines effectively manage commands applied to a state machine
   * like memory. It's always the responsibility of a state machine to indicate when a command can be safely
   * compacted according to its compaction mode by releasing the command back to the server's storage layer for
   * compaction. See the state machine documentation for more info.

     * <p>
     * While commands with the {@code SNAPSHOT} compaction mode may be removed once a snapshot of the state machine state
     * has been taken, it's still safe for {@code SNAPSHOT} commands to trigger state machine events. In the event that
     * a command triggers an event to a client, servers will ensure that the command is maintained in the log until
     * all associated events have been received by clients. That is, commands will never be replaced by a snapshot prior to
     * events being received by clients. In the event of a failure and replay of the log, the state machine will always
