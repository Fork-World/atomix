/**
 * Stores a single replicated value, providing atomic operations for modifying the value.
 * <p>
 * The value resource stores a single value that can be accessed across the Atomix cluster. The value
 * must be of a type that is serializable by the {@link io.atomix.catalyst.serializer.Serializer} on
 * any client that opens the resource and on all replicas in the cluster. Atomic operations like
 * {@link #compareAndSet(Object, Object)} can be used to check and update the state of the value.
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   DistributedValue<String> value = atomix.getValue("foo").get();
 *   value.compareAndSet("foo", "bar").thenAccept(succeeded -> {
 *     ...
 *   });
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Changes to the state of the value are linearizable and are therefore guaranteed to take place some
 * time between the invocation of a state changing method and the completion of the returned
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture}.
 * <h3>Implementation</h3>
 * State management for the {@code DistributedValue} resource is implemented as a basic Copycat
 * {@link io.atomix.copycat.server.StateMachine}. Changes to the value are written to a log and replicated
 * to a majority of the cluster before being applied to the state machine. State change are applied to the
 * state machine atomically, and the state machine keeps track of state changes that apply to the current
 * system state. Once a write no longer contributes to the state machine's state, it is released to be
 * removed from the log during compaction.
