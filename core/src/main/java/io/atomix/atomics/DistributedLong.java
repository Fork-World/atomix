/**
 * Stores a replicated 64-bit number, supporting atomic increments, decrements, and compare-and-set.
 * <p>
 * The {@code DistributedLong} resource is modeled on Java's {@link java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong},
 * providing asynchronous versions of all the methods present in that class. Users can use {@code DistributedLong}
 * to generate unique IDs or monotonically increasing tokens or as a counter. State change operations are
 * linearizable and are therefore guaranteed to take place some time between the invocation of a state change
 * method and the completion of the returned {@link CompletableFuture}.
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   DistributedLong value = atomix.getLong("foo").get();
 *   value.set(1).join();
 *   value.incrementAndGet(value -> {
 *     ...
 *   });
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * <h3>Implementation</h3>
 * State management for the {@code DistributedLong} resource is implemented as a snapshottable Copycat
 * {@link io.atomix.copycat.server.StateMachine}. Changes to the long value are written to a log and
 * replicated to a majority of the cluster before being applied to the state machine. State changes
 * are applied to the state machine atomically, and the value is stored in a single 64-bit field.
 * Periodically, a 64-bit snapshot of the resource's state is written to disk, and prior
 * {@link #incrementAndGet() increment} and {@link #decrementAndGet() decrement} operations are removed
 * from the replicated log during compaction.
